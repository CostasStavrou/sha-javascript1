      <li><a href="./exercise01.js">Exercise 1</a> - Create a function that takes 3 arguments
      and returns the sum of the three arguments.</li>
      <li><a href="./exercise02.js">Exercise 2</a> - Create a function named colorCar that receives a color,
      and prints out, "a red car" for example. (Hint: put it in your file and run it like
      before.)</li>
      <li><a href="./exercise03.js">Exercise 3</a> - Create a function named vehicleType
      that receives a color, and a code, 1 for car, 2 for motorbike. And prints "a blue
      motorbike" for example when called as vehicleType("blue", 2)</li>
      <li><a href="./exercise04.js">Exercise 4</a> - Can you write the following without the if statement,
      but with just as a single line with console.log(...);?<br>
      <pre>
        if (3 == 3) {
          console.log("true")
        } else {
          console.log("false")
        }
      </pre></li>
      <li><a href="./exercise05.js">Exercise 5</a> - Create a function called vehicle,
      like before, but takes another parameter called age, so that
        <ul>
          <li>vehicle("blue", 1, 2) prints "a blue used car".</li>
          <li>vehicle("blue", 1, 1) prints "a blue new car".</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="./exercise06.js">Exercise 6</a> - Make a list of vehicles, you can add
      "motorbike", "caravan", "bike", or more.</li>

      element from that list?</li>
      <li><a href="./exercise08.js">Exercise 8</a> - Change the function vehicle to use
      the list of question 6. So that vehicle("green", 3, 1) prints "a green new caravan".</li>
      <li><a href="./exercise09.js">Exercise 9</a> - Use the list of vehicles to write an
      advertisement. So that it prints something like: "Amazing Joe's Garage, we service
      cars, motorbikes, caravans and bikes.". (Hint: use a for loop.)</li>
      <li><a href="./exercise10.js">Exercise 10</a> - What if you add one more vehicle to the
      list, can you have that added to the advertisement without changing the code for
      question 9?</li>
      <li><a href="./exercise11.js">Exercise 11</a> - Write some code to test two arrays for
      equality using == and ===. Test the following:<br>
      <pre>
        var x = [1,2,3];
        var y = [1,2,3];
        var z = y;
      </pre>
      What do you think will happen with x == y, x === y and z == y and z == x? Prove it!</li>
      <li><a href="./exercise12.js">Exercise 12</a> - What does the following code return? (And
      why?)<br>
      <pre>
